Currant is a single-threaded programming language that runs in the browser. It has simple interoperability with JavaScript and can be easily embedded into a webpage:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="currant.js"></script>
        <currant-script>
            log("Hello, Currant!");
        </currant-script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```
